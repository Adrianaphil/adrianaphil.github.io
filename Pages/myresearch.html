        <h3>Witnessing-sleep</h3>
            <p>My PhD project aims to develop a philosophical account of conscious dreamless sleep – conscious phenomena 
                had during sleep that don’t fit within a description of dreams. In particular, my investigation focused 
                on the so-called experience of witnessing-sleep (Fort, 1980; Chatterje, 1982; Gupta, 1998).</p>  
            <p>The experience of witnessing-sleep has been largely described by contemplative traditions, including the Indian 
                philosophical school of Advaita Vedanta. These traditions describe witnessing-sleep as an awareness had during 
                dreamless sleep that is objectless and contentless (that’s it, that it lacks any object or content of awareness). 
                For the Advaitns, witnessing-sleep is sushupti (Sanskrit: सुषुप्ति); one of the four states of consciousness (Mandukya Upanishad, Olivelle, 1998: 475). 
                Other traditions, like Tibetan Buddhism, refer to this experience under the name of ‘Yoga Nidra’ or ‘Sleep Yoga’(Norbu, 1983; Wangyal Tenzin, 1998; 
                Gyatrul, Khandro, & Wallace, 2002). More recently, some more contemporary authors have referred to it as 
                'lucid dreamless sleep' (Thompson, 2014, 2015; Windt, 2015; Windt, Nielsen and Thompson, 2016).</p>
            <p>My PhD project is divided into two major strands of research:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Conceptual work</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some questions that I ask are the following: How should we better describe dreamless sleep experiences? Are those dreams or a sui generis class of experiences? And, if we aren’t dreams, why aren’t they?</p>
            <p>Can we have an objectless sort of dreamless sleep experience? How would this look like? And if we can, which implications would its existence has to other accounts on the nature of consciousness? Can we explain consciousness without alluding to an ‘object’ of awareness? </p>    
            <ul>
            <li><b>Empirical work</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>I’m also collecting new evidence on the experience of witnessing-sleep. With that purpose, I’m carrying out a new qualitative study where I’ll interview participants reporting awareness during dreamless sleep.

                <li><b>Abstract</b>– This paper presents a pilot study that explores instances of objectless awareness during sleep: conscious experiences had during sleep that prima facie lacks an object of awareness. This state of objectless awareness during sleep has been widely described by Indian contemplative traditions and has been characterised as a state of consciousness-as-such; while in it, there is nothing to be aware of, one is merely conscious (cf. Evans-Wentz 1960; Fremantle 2001; Ponlop 2006). While this phenomenon has received different names in the literature, such as ‘witnessing-sleep’ and ‘clear light sleep’ among others, the specific phenomenological profile of this state has not yet been rigorously studied. This paper aims at presenting a preliminary investigation of objectless consciousness during sleep using a novel tool in qualitative research that can guide future research.</li>
