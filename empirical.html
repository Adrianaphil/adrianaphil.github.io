            <p>This study aims to investigate the incidence of a particular kind of sleep experience described by Indian contemplative traditions as an experience of consciousness had during sleep that does not involve further objects of awareness (i.e. individuals are not aware of something; they say to be merely aware and nothing else).</p>
            <p>While objectless dreamless sleep experiences have been anecdotally reported, mainly by individuals engaged in a particular conceptual system, there is no reason to believe that these phenomena could also be experienced by the wider population.</p></p>
          </div>        
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>However, there is a lack of rigorous investigation on this sort of experiences, which results in the absence of an adequate conceptualisation of these phenomena. As such, this study will explore the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What does objectless dreamless sleep involve? How this experience should be described?</li>
      <li>How can we situate objectless dreamless sleep within a wider classification of sleep phenomena?</li>
      <li>Are they any particular conditions that facilitate having such experience?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Regardless of whether you have experienced this sort of experience before, you are invited to take part in 
        the online questionnaire of dreamless sleep experiences. The questionnaire investigates different experiences 
        that you might have had during your sleep and while falling asleep. If you want to participate, find out
        more below.</p>
