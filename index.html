             <p>Hi! I’m Adriana (she/her), an <a href="https://www.sgsah.ac.uk/">SGSAH-funded</a> PhD candidate in Philosophy at the 
              <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/cspe/">Centre for the Study of the Perceptual Experience (CSPE)</a>, University of Glasgow
               (also affiliated to the University of Edinburgh) working under the supervision of Prof Fiona Macpherson.</p>                
             <p>I’m an interdisciplinary researcher and my investigation falls at the intersection of philosophy of mind, psychology and neuroscience. 
               For my PhD thesis, I’m investigating the phenomenology of minimal forms of consciousness during sleep, including dreams and 
               dreamless sleep experiences. In my research, I encourage the dialogue between Western and Eastern philosophical traditions by examining 
               how Indian philosophical traditions, such as the Advaita Vedanta and Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, conceive the idea of a contentless state of 
               awareness during sleep.</p>
             <p>I’m eager to connect and collaborate with other researchers working on the nature of consciousness, altered states of consciousness
                and cognitive science. Feel free to contact me or reach out.</p>

    <h1 class= "heading"> About Me </h1>
    <div class="aboutMe">
      <p> I’m originally from Barcelona, Spain, and I changed the Mediterranean weather for the Scottish lands 5 years ago to pursue my research on consciousness at the 
        CSPE. I’m currently in the final year of my PhD, and I also work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) for sub-honour courses in both philosophy and psychology, and honours courses 
          in philosophy at the 
        University of Glasgow. </p>                         
      <p>I’m very enthusiastic about organising different academic activities, always aiming at facilitating a friendly and inclusive environment that fosters 
        interdisciplinarity and promotes the work of early-career researchers and individuals pertaining to a minority group. You can check some of the activities 
        I have organised <a href="./Pages/activities.html" target="_blank">here.</a> I also act as mentor to philosophy students as part of the 
        <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/humanities/gender/mentoring/" target="_blank"> Women in Philosophy Mentorship Programme by the University of Glasgow </a>, 
        but I would be happy to offer advice and guidance to other students and early career researchers not affiliated with my institution who need some form of support</p>
      <p>In the past, I have also been an active member of the Minorities and Philosophy (MAP) chapter at Glasgow, as well as the Diversity Officer for the PhD society. 
        I like to blog about my academic experiences, and I <a href="https://uofgpgrblog.com/search?q=adriana+alcaraz" target="_blank">wrote several posts on mental health, 
          inclusion and interdisciplinarity in academia </a> during my role as PGR Intern Blogger for the University of Glasgow. 
          I also manage <a href="https://thesecretlifeoffoxes.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">my blog </a> where I post some more informal posts on a more variety of topics. 
      <p>Outside academia I love discovering new places (especially if they have tasty vegetarian food), hiking in the Scottish hills (and Munros) 
       and practising roller skating. I’m also an aficionado photographer and some of my shots can be found <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hawally" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
