             <p> Hi! I’m Adriana (she/her) and I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the                 
              <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/philosophical-psychology/">Centre for Philosophical Psychology (CSPE)</a>, University of Antwerp, Belgium.
               working under the supervision of Prof Bence Nanay.</p>                
             <p>I’m an interdisciplinary researcher and my investigation falls at the intersection of philosophy of mind, psychology and neuroscience. 
               Previous to my current post, I was a SGSAH-funded PhD student at the University of Glasgow, where I worked under the supervision of Fiona Macpherson.
                For my PhD thesis, I investigated the phenomenology of minimal forms of consciousness during sleep, including dreams and 
               dreamless sleep experiences. Currently, I'm investigating the links between immersive sleep experiences, such as dreaming, and 
                 other imaginative experiences during wakefulness like daydreaming.
                 In my research, I encourage the dialogue between Western and Eastern philosophical traditions by examining 
               how Indian philosophical traditions, such as the Advaita Vedanta and Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, conceive the idea of a contentless state of 
               awareness during sleep.</p>
             <p>I’m eager to connect and collaborate with other researchers working on the nature of consciousness, altered states of consciousness
                and cognitive science. Feel free to contact me or reach out.</p>

    <h1 class= "heading"> About Me </h1>
    <div class="aboutMe">
      <p> I’m originally from Barcelona, Spain. After 8 years living in the UK, I moved to Antwerp, Belgium, where I started my employment as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Philosophy. </p>                         
      <p>I’m very enthusiastic about organising different academic activities, always aiming at facilitating a friendly and inclusive environment that fosters 
        interdisciplinarity and promotes the work of early-career researchers and individuals pertaining to a minority group. You can check some of the activities 
        I have organised <a href="./Pages/activities.html" target="_blank">here.</a> I also act as a mentor to philosophy students as part of the 
        <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/humanities/gender/mentoring/" target="_blank"> Women in Philosophy Mentorship Programme by the University of Glasgow </a>, 
        but I would be happy to offer advice and guidance to other students and early career researchers not affiliated with my institution who need some form of support</p>
      <p> In the past, I have also been an active member of the Minorities and Philosophy (MAP) chapter at Glasgow, as well as the Diversity Officer for the PhD society. 
        I like to blog about my academic experiences, and I <a href="https://uofgpgrblog.com/search?q=adriana+alcaraz" target="_blank">wrote several posts on mental health, 
          inclusion and interdisciplinarity in academia </a> during my role as PGR Intern Blogger for the University of Glasgow. 
          I also manage <a href="https://thesecretlifeoffoxes.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">my blog </a> where I post some more informal posts on a variety of topics. 
      <p>Outside academia I love discovering new places (especially if they have tasty vegetarian food), hiking, and 
       and practising roller skating. I’m also an aficionado photographer and some of my shots can be found <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hawally" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
